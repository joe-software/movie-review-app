# Movie Search App

This app allows a user to search for movie, and see the relevant information. It also contains the functionality to allow reviews to be written and viewed using a Mongo database.  

**Demo: https://joe-software.github.io/movie-review-app/**

## Tech used

This app uses React.JS and HTML/CSS and uses Styled-Components to manage CSS/styling. The app connects to an external server to make API calls and retrieve and post data to a Mongo db.

The app uses an API from: https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-GB

## Lessons Learned

During this project, I learned the complexities of developing client and server side code, and ensuring that they work together. There was a delay in hosting the server side code, so releasing versions in stages became useful.

### Executing program

To view a demo:

To run the code:
'npm install'
'npm start'

## Optimizations

This app is still awaiting the hosting of an API server, which is connected to Mongo DB, allowing users to write and read reviews. The code allowing this has been commented out, but will be updated soon.
