# Movie Search App

This app allows a user to search for movie, and see the relevant information. Soon, it will also contain the functionality to allow reviews to be written and viewed using a Mongo database.  

**Demo: https://joe-software.github.io/movie-review-app/**

## Tech used

This app uses React.JS and HTML/CSS and uses Styled-Components to manage CSS/styling. It has the code in place ready to use GET and POST API calls, but theyt are commented out until the API/server side code is hosted. 

## Lessons Learned

During this project, I learned the complexities of developing client and server side code, and ensuring that they work together. There is a delay in hosting the server side code, which means that not all of the functionality of this App is currently available.

### Executing program

To view a demo:

To run the code:
'npm install'
'npm start'

## Optimizations

This app is still awaiting the hosting of an API server, which is connected to Mongo DB, allowing users to write and read reviews. The code allowing this has been commented out, but will be updated soon.
